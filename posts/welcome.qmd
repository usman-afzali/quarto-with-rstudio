I have started using `Quarto` in December 2022. In this blog, I mainly share code as I learn and produce. Most of the code shall involve `documentation`, `statistics`, `slides`, and `version control`. I mainly use Quarto with `RStudio` on a MacBook. Please keep this in mind in case you are using a different machine.

## About me

I am a postdoctoral research fellow and PI of [`A national longitudinal study of Muslim diversity and flourishing`](https://usman-afzali.github.io/nzavs-flourishing/), based at University of Canterbury in New Zealand.
Psychology fascinates me a great deal and my lifelong goal is to conduct good science and contribute to open science.
I am experienced in teaching statistics and research methods and my immediate goal is to become a permanent (tenure-track) `lecturer in psychology`.
